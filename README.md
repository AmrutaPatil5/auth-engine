# 🛡️ AuthEngine v1

**AuthEngine** is a robust, full-stack Authentication and User Management system. Built with a focus on security and modern UI/UX, it provides a seamless experience for user registration, secure login, profile management, and account recovery.

The project features a sleek **Glassmorphism** design on the frontend and a production-ready **Node.js/Express** backend.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AuthEngine.git](https://github.com/your-username/AuthEngine.git)
```
```bash
cd AuthEngine
```

### 2. Backend Setup
The root directory serves as the backend server.

Install Backend Dependencies: Ensure you are in the root folder **(AuthEngine)**, then run:
```bash
npm install
```

Configure Environment Variables: Create a **.env** file in the root directory and add the following credentials:
```bash
PORT=8000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CORS_ORIGIN=*
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_token_secret
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=10d

# Cloudinary Credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Email Service (Mailtrap)
MAILTRAP_SMTP_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAILTRAP_SMTP_PORT=2525
MAILTRAP_SMTP_USER=your_mailtrap_user
MAILTRAP_SMTP_PASS=your_mailtrap_password

# Client URLs (For Redirects)
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
FORGOT_PASSWORD_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:5173/reset-password
```

Start the Backend Server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
You should see "Server running on port 8000" and "MongoDB Connected".

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a New Terminal.

Navigate to the Client Folder:
```bash
cd client
```
Install Frontend Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
**Configure Environment Variables:** Create a **.env** file in the client folder to point to your backend:
```bash
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
```
Start the React App:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Access the App: 
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173
